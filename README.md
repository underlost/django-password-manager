The app is based loosely on [django-password-manager](https://github.com/Chouffe/django-password-manager), however at this point it's only a source of information and guidance. Passe has been rewritten from the ground up to support python 3, Django 2, and frontend frameworks like Bootstrap 4.1. The structure and password hashing has also been replaced.
